Boomerang is a template for a dynamic material design GDG chapter web site that can be deployed
within 30 minutes. It pulls data from [GDG-X Hub](https://github.com/gdg-x/hub) and 
[Google+ API](https://developers.google.com/+/api/) using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and 
[Angular-Material](https://material.angularjs.org).

See it in action: http://gdg-x.github.io/boomerang

There are multiple forked versions for Google App Engine
* Java - https://github.com/Splaktar/boomerang-gae
* Python - https://github.com/neojato/boomerang-gae

Configuration

Update app/services/configService.js with values appropriate for your group:

1. **name**: The name of your GDG
2. **id**: The ID of the Google+ page for your GDG; for example, if your page
   URL is https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/115803993493374365281/, then the ID is '115803993493374365281'.
3. **google_api**: The API key for your project, available from the [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/console)
  1. Create a new project then go to APIs & Auth->APIs, activate Google+ API.
  2. Go to APIs & Auth->Credentials and under Public API access 'Create new Key' of BrowserKey with `Any referrer allowed`.
4. **pwa_id**: The ID for a Picasa web album from which pictures will be drawn. If you do not have a Picasa web album
   for your group, you will want to comment out the photos tab in **index.html**.
5. **twitter**, **facebook**, **meetup**: Update these with your chapter's social network handles. Setting them to '' will hide the icon.
6. Create your Google Analytics account and modify the Google Analytics tracking code in **index.html**.

Additional Optional Config
---------------
1. **domain**: Your custom domain name (or base appspot URL).
2. **cover.title**: An announcement that will appear on the landing page.
3. **cover.subtitle**: More text to support the landing page announcement.
4. **cover.button.text**: Text for the announcement button.
5. **cover.button.url**: The URL that the announcement button will open in another window.
6. **cover.url**: If the cover image drawn from your Google+ page does not work with the default layout,
   you can specify a URL for a specific image instead.
7. Edit the snippet details in the **index.html** to change how your page looks when it is shared.
8. Modify the images in war/app/images/sponsor1 and war/app/images/sponsor2 to be your sponsor images.
9. Modify the sponsor links in **about.html**.

Building
---------------
Here you will install dependencies and tooling, build, minify, run static analysis, and more.
You must have Node.js installed to use the build tools. Download it [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).
From the boomerang directory, run the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `gulp`

Automated Testing
---------------
1. Unit tests can be run once via `gulp karma` or constantly via `gulp karma-watch`.
2. Integration tests can be run via:
  1. `node node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update`
  2. `node node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager start`
  3. Then in a separate terminal: `node node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor test/e2e/conf.js`
3. WebStorm or IntelliJ IDEA can make this testing a lot easier if you configure the idea to do it for you.

Testing locally
---------------
If you aren't using App Engine, you should be able to test locally with Node.js using the following:

1. `npm install http-server -g`
2. `cd boomerang`
3. `http-server -o`

Deployment
---------------
Deploy on your web server of choice (Apache, Nginx, etc).
If you need a web server, Google App Engine's free tier should be more than sufficient for your chapter's needs.

Development Details
---------------
Make sure that you do the following successfully before committing:

1. `gulp prod` - Make sure you fix any JSCS or JSHint errors.
2. `gulp karma` - Make sure that you fix any broken tests.
3. Protractor tests - Make sure that you fix any broken tests.
4. If you changed any dependency versions in `bower.json`, make sure that `config/CDN.json` is updated to match.
